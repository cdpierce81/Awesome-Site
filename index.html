		<h1>Danielle's Amazing Site!!</h1>
			<br>
			<p>This is my <strong><em>FIRST</em></strong> website and I am very excited about it! <br>
			<br>
			I started coding a year ago and have come <em>really</em> far, so check out my journey...</p>

		<h2>First, there was JavaScript!!</h2>

			<br>
			<p>I started coding with JavaScript in the summer of 2015 so, technically, it has been two years. 
				But, I didn't really start coding seriously until August 2016.<br>
			<br>
				In 2015, I was at home one day, it was early morning and I said to myself, "I want to do something
				career wise that I can do from home." The first thing that came to my mind was "<em>COMPUTERS</em>"!
				Computers are cool and fun and I think that they are the way of the future. So, I looked up "computer
				jobs" on Google. (Unless you know exactly what it is that you would like to do with computers as a
				career, I would not suggest doing such a broad search like I did.)<br>
			<br>
				There were waaaaaay too many options and directions to choose from but I didn't know where to start.
				I knew about designing with computers, like animation for movies and games and even website design,
				so I decided to take that route. Not knowing where to begin, I immediately thought of Khan Academy.
				They had things on their site about learning just about anything, from preschool to college, so I
				decided to check them out.<br>
			<br>
				At that time, they only had Computer Programming: Intro to JS: drawing and animation, which talked about
				getting started with programming using JavaScript and animation basics. This was a good start for
				me given I had no direction anyway. I jumped in and I learned variables and functions and cute
				little animation tricks, and I thought, "This is pretty cool!" After a couple of weeks, my mind
				started to stray and I put it down for awhile. (I also have very bad migraines that also played a
				factor in my learning delay.)<br>
			<br>
				In August 2016, I had a conversation with my bestfriend about life and she told me that she had
				started to code. She said that another friend of hers had told her about coding and building
				websites with HTML and CSS. I told her that that was great and that I had been learning JavaScript
				on Khan Academy. She told me that there is no real place to start because you eventually will have
				to learn all of them. She sent me a pic of a site that she was working on and I was in awe. She was
				doing what I wanted to be doing, in a sense. (I hadn't quite figured that part out yet.) From that
				part on, I was lit up like a rocket. I got back on Khan Academy to finish my learning!<br>
			<br>
				Everything was so different. They had a new layout for computer programming with JavaScript. There
				was a video about programming to start with that showed other websites to access for coding. After
				that it went on to the original material that they already had plus there was lots of material added
				on like drawing basics, variables and basic animation. I was pleased. I felt that I had picked a
				great time to jump back in. I started over from the very beginning so that I could get the new information
				along with the original information.<br>
			<br>
				After 3 months this time, I hit a wall and decided to take a break,
				which I did for about a week. It was Thanksgiving and the kids were out for a week so as soon as they went
				back to school I jumped back in, from the beginning, again...for a month! I got stuck again in the same place.
				I just couldn't work it out. I thought that I knew but what I thought just wasn't working. So, I quit.
				I gave up. I wasn't understanding it or either it wasn't sticking. (And with migraines, it was very frustrating.)
				January rolled around and I peaked at it and still the same thing. . .<br>
			<br>
				June 2017. Yes, six months later. My friend moved back down and showed me all of her progress after a year
				of continuous work on her website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was awestruck, again! This could have been
				me. If only I had stuck with it. So, guess what I did? Yep, that's right! I started over, again!!
